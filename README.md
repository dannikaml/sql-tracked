# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker


## Description
***
A command-line application to manage a company's employee database. This application allows the user to view the Departments, Roles, and Employees - which department the employees are assigned to, what their role/job is, their manager (if applicable), and what the salary for each employee. The user can also ADD a department, role, or employee and DELETE an employee.  The application allows the user to catalog Employee info by utilizing using Node.js, Inquirer 8.2.4, and MySQL.


# Usage
***
By utilizing Node.js, Inquirer 8.2.4 and MySQL 2 we can create a command-line application that dynamically generates an employee database. 

To install inquirer, please use:

```
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```
To install MySQL 2:
```
npm i mysql2
```

To view tables in the command line:
```
npm i console.table
```

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
```
node index.js
```
